You can create a patch manually or download it from an external source.\\n\\n4. **Modify `Makefile` if necessary**: If your patch is not automatically recognized, you might need to modify the `Makefile` to ensure the new patches are included in the build process.\\n\\n5. **Recompile the port**: Once your patches are in place, you can recompile the port using the `make` command. Run `make` in the port's directory to compile it while applying the changes from your patches.\\n\\n6. **Install the patched port**: After compiling, use `make install` to install the new version of KDE with the applied patches.\\n\\n7. **Test**: Finally, after installation, test your KDE environment to ensure everything works correctly with the new patches.\\n\\nAlways remember to check the documentation for your specific version of FreeBSD and KDE for any version-specific instructions or dependencies.\",\n",

      "answer: No, you can only get a certificate if you finish the course with a “live” cohort. We don't award certificates for the self-paced mode. The reason is you need to peer-review capstone(s) after submitting a project. You can only peer-review projects at the time the course is running.\n",

      "The course covers 2 alternative data stacks, one using GCP and one using local installation of everything. You can use one of them or use your tool of choice.\n",
      "Should you consider it instead of the one tool you use? That we can’t support you if you choose to use a different stack, also you would need to explain the different choices of tool for the peer review of your capstone project.\n",

      "Having this local repository on your computer will make it easy for you to access the instructors’ code and make pull requests (if you want to add your own notes or make changes to the course content).\n",
      "You will probably also create your own repositories that host your notes, versions of your file, to do this. Here is a great tutorial that shows you how to do this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository\n",
      "Remember to ignore large database, .csv, and .gz files, and other files that should not be saved to a repository. Use .gitignore for this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore NEVER store passwords or keys in a git repo (even if that repo is set to private).\n",

      "import findspark\n",
      "findspark.init()\n",

      "Another possible solution is:\n",
      "Check that pyspark is pointing to the correct location.\n",
      "Run pyspark.__file__. It should be list /home/<your user name>/spark/spark-3.0.3-bin-hadoop3.2/python/pyspark/__init__.py if you followed the videos.\n",
      "If it is pointing to your python site-packages remove the pyspark directory there and check that you have added the correct exports to you .bashrc file and that there are not any other exports which might supersede the ones provided in the course content.\n",
      "To add to the solution above, if the errors persist in regards to setting the correct path for spark,  an alternative solution for permanent path setting solve the error is  to set environment variables on system and user environment variables following this tutorial: Install Apache PySpark on Windows PC | Apache Spark Installation Guide\n",
      "Once everything is installed, skip to 7:14 to set up environment variables. This allows for the environment variables to be set permanently.\n",

      "question: Course - Can I follow the course after it finishes?\n",
      "answer: Yes, we will keep all the materials after the course finishes, so you can follow the course at your own pace after it finishes.\n",
      "You can also continue looking at the homeworks and continue preparing for the next cohort. I guess you can also start working on your final capstone project.\n",

      "section: General course-related questions\n",
      "question: Certificate - Can I follow the course in a self-paced mode and get a certificate?\n",
      "answer: No, you can only get a certificate if you finish the course with a “live” cohort. We don't award certificates for the self-paced mode. The reason is you need to peer-review capstone(s) after submitting a project. You can only peer-review projects at the time the course is running.\n",

      "section: General course-related questions\n",
      "question: Is it possible to use tool “X” instead of the one tool you use in the course?\n",
      "answer: Yes, this applies if you want to use Airflow or Prefect instead of Mage, AWS or Snowflake instead of GCP products or Tableau instead of Metabase or Google data studio.\n",
      "The course covers 2 alternative data stacks, one using GCP and one using local installation of everything. You can use one of them or use your tool of choice.\n",
      "Should you consider it instead of the one tool you use? That we can’t support you if you choose to use a different stack, also you would need to explain the different choices of tool for the peer review of your capstone project.\n",
      "\n",
      "section: General course-related questions\n",
      "question: How do I use Git / GitHub for this course?\n",
      "answer: After you create a GitHub account, you should clone the course repo to your local machine using the process outlined in this video: Git for Everybody: How to Clone a Repository from GitHub\n",
      "Having this local repository on your computer will make it easy for you to access the instructors’ code and make pull requests (if you want to add your own notes or make changes to the course content).\n",
      "You will probably also create your own repositories that host your notes, versions of your file, to do this. Here is a great tutorial that shows you how to do this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository\n",
      "Remember to ignore large database, .csv, and .gz files, and other files that should not be saved to a repository. Use .gitignore for this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore NEVER store passwords or keys in a git repo (even if that repo is set to private).\n",
